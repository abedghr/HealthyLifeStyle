                            <p class="excert">
                        The Food Pyramid  is a chart that can be used to see how many servings of each food should be eaten each day designed to make healthy eating easier. Healthy eating is about getting the correct amount of nutrients – protein, fat, carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals you need to maintain good health.
                            </p>
							
                            <p>
							Foods that contain the same type of nutrients are grouped together on each of the shelves of the Food Pyramid. This gives you a choice of different foods from which to choose a healthy diet. Following the Food Pyramid as a guide will help you get the right balance of nutritious foods within your calorie range. Studies show that we take in too many calories from foods and drinks high in fat, sugar and salt, on the top shelf of the Food Pyramid. They provide very little of the essential vitamins and minerals your body needs. Limiting these is essential for healthy eating.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                              Grains give carbohydrates and some vitamins and minerals. Vegetables and fruits give a lot of vitamins, some minerals, and few fats, but fruits often have more calories and sugar. Dairy products (like milk, cheese, yogurt, etc.) have protein, some fat, and a lot of calcium, an element that helps build strong bones. Meat have protein, some fat, and B vitamins. Fats, oils, and sweets give calories, fats, and sugars but not a lot of nutrition.
                            </p>
							<p>
							So in a nutshell, healthy eating involves:
lenty of vegetables, salad and fruit
a serving of wholemeal cereals and breads, potatoes, pasta and rice at every meal - go for wholegrain varieties wherever possible
some milk, yoghurt and cheese
some meat, poultry, fish, eggs, beans and nuts
a very small amount of fats, spreads and oils
and a very small amount or no foods and drinks high in fat, sugar and salt.

                            <p class="excert">
							
							All plants and animals need water to survive. There can be no life on earth without water. Why is water so important? Because 60 percent of our body weight is made up of water. Our bodies use water in all the cells, organs, and tissues, to help regulate body temperature and maintain other bodily functions. Because our bodies lose water through breathing, sweating, and digestion, it's crucial to rehydrate and replace water by drinking fluids and eating foods that contain water.



Let’s look at all the ways water impacts our lives…

							    </p>
							<ol><Li>Water helps by creating saliva:
Water is the main component of saliva. It’s critical for breaking down solid food and keeping your mouth healthy. If you find your mouth is drier than usual, increase your water intake.
</li>
							
							<Li>It regulates body temperature:
							Staying hydrated is critical to maintaining a normal body temperature. Our bodies lose water when we sweat, and in hot environments. Sweat keeps our bodies cool, but our body temperatures will go up if we don’t replenish the water we lose. That lack of water causes dehydration, which in turn causes levels of electrolytes and plasma to drop
							</li>
							
							
							<Li>Water aids cognitive functions:
Proper hydration is crucial to staying in good cognitive shape. Research has shown that inadequate water intake can negatively impact our focus, alertness, and short-term memory</Li>
							
							<Li>Water protects the tissues, spinal cord, and joints:

Water  helps lubricate and cushion our joints, spinal cord, and tissues. This helps us to be more physically active, and reduces the discomfort caused by conditions such as arthritis
</Li>
							
							<Li>It helps excrete the waste in our bodies through perspiration, urination, and defecation:
Our bodies use water to sweat, urinate, and pass healthy bowel movements. We all need water to replenish fluids lost from sweating. We also need water in our systems to have healthy stools and avoid constipation. Drinking enough water helps our kidneys to work more efficiently  thus preventing kidney stones
</Li>
							<Li>Water maximizes our physical performance:

Drinking plenty of water while working out, taking part in sports or just being on the move, is essential.  Keeping ourselves hydrated also affects our strength, power, and endurance
</Li>
							<Li>It helps to boost our energy levels:

Drinking water helps to boost our metabolic rate. This boost has a positive impact on our energy levels. Drinking 500 milliliters of water can boost the metabolic rate by 30 percent in both men and women, one study has found. Negative effects of exercising in the heat, without staying hydrated, can result in serious medical incidents. In fact, extreme dehydration can cause seizures, and sometimes, even death.</Li>
							
							
                        </ol>

<P>Water prevents overall dehydration
Dehydration is the result of the body being deprived of adequate water. And,  since water is critical for the successful functioning of many bodily functions, dehydration can be very dangerous. Even leading to fatal consequences. Severe dehydration can lead to serious outcomes, including:
</p>				
					<ol>
					    <LI>swelling in the brain</li>
						<LI>kidney failure</li>
						<LI>seizures</li>
						<LI>Make sure to drink enough water to replace what’s lost through sweating, urination, and bowel movements, to avoid dehydration.</li>
				
				
					</ol>
					
	<br>
												
							
<div>	<p>						
The importance of water:

It’s pretty obvious that having adequate water in your body  is critical to nearly every part of it. Not only will maintaining your recommended daily intake help you to maintain your current state of good health, it could also improve it in the long run. The amount of water you need will depend on the environment and climate you live in, how physically active you are, and whether you are suffering from an illness, ailment or  any other health problems.</p>
					<p>
					
Here are some ways to make sure that  you drink enough water:

Carry a water bottle with you wherever you go. Keep taking sips from it as and when you feel the need				
	

Track your water intake. Make sure you consume the optimum amount every day, which is a minimum of half your body weight, in ounces/milligrams.

 <strong>How to start a healthy lifestyle</strong></Q>  </center>


<P style="font-family:arial;font-size:20px">Everything starts for a reason and fitness is no exception to the rule. 
Unless you have a really good reason to start you won't be able to stay committed and follow through with your resolutions. 
The good news is that most of it is mental which means 
you can actually put a plan of action in place that will remove all the obstacles standing between 
you and your fitness goals:

<br>




<center  style="color:blue;font-size:30px">Start small</center>

<span style="font-family:arial;font-size:15px">
 What you really need is to change your habits,
and how you feel and look will change on their own.
The moment you concentrate on the action and not on the end result is when you truly transform
, inside and out. Start with small changes in your diet and exercise habits, 
 start by eating better and adding a few squats and planks into your daily routine or pick up a 30-day challenge.
 It is important that you stick to the small things first,
 before you demand anything more radical from yourself.
 The harder you push from the start the harder it’ll be to stay on track. 
</span>
<br>




<center  style="color:blue;font-size:30px">Find the right activity for yourself</center>

<span style="font-family:arial;font-size:15px">
If you push yourself into something you absolutely hate doing
, your commitment however strong to begin with, will very soon wear off. 
You need to try and find the right thing for yourself, an activity you’
ll love or can learn to love. Perhaps running will be the thing for you,
 or boxing or bodyweight training – you won’t know for sure until you try.
 So go for a run, do a martial art session, 
 try a routine online until you stumble upon the right one for yourself.
 The more you try, the higher the chances of finding the one. 
</span>



<br>




<center  style="color:blue;font-size:30px">Pick a reasonable eating plan</center>

<span style="font-family:arial;font-size:15px">

All you need is a guide, something you can easily follow without checking on a list of forbidden food and special instructions each time you want to have a meal. 
Calorie counting will only stress you out and make you feel miserable every time you bite into anything edible.
 What you want is something you can maintain your whole life, not just for a month or two. Eating reasonably and mindfully will very soon become the norm if the terms are minimal.
 Think of it this way, high value foods have to be earned  - candy, baked goods, sodas. 
 Just because you want to lead a healthy lifestyle it doesn’t mean you can never touch any of it ever again, 
 it only means that they can no longer be on your daily menu, better things should. Real food is usually the way to go, cooked food with the fewest ingredients possible.
 Homemade and fresh is what you want. 
</span>
<br>



<center  style="color:blue;font-size:30px">Shop in advance, shop smart</center>

<span style="font-family:arial;font-size:15px">
What you eat is just as important as what you do exercise wise.
 Most us know how easy it is to fall off track when you get hungry after a workout and you think:
 well I deserve a treat since I worked for it.
 Unfortunately we usually overestimate just how much we work and treat ourselves just a little bit too much completely cancelling out all our hard work.
 In most cases treating yourself as a reward for training is a bad idea.
 To avoid snap food related decisions make sure you know what you eat in advance and have a clear plan for your every meal. 
 More than that, buy all of the ingredients beforehand and make sure you cook and sit down for every dish. 
 Cooking your own meals will work out cheaper and it'll be a lot better for you than a takeout,
 plus it doesn't actually take a lot of time to grill some meat and make a salad. Even home-made burgers you can freeze will only take 20 minutes in the oven.
 Optimise the cooking and eating processes and it'll be half the battle already won

 </span><br>



 
 

<center  style="color:blue;font-size:30px">Go slow</center>

<span style="font-family:arial;font-size:15px">
The slower you go the further you’ll get in your fitness journey.
Fast results may be very tempting, but every shortcut comes at a price you won’t be willing to pay.
 The faster your body changes, whether it is weight loss or muscle gain, the more of a shock it is to your system.
 And although you may like what you see short term, in the long run your body will try and get back to what it knows, 
 the comfortable weight and shape it had and it will do it in the blink of an eye the moment you get back to the lifestyle you used to have,
 when the program is finished and when the diet is over.
 With fitness, there is no end date, you make it part of who you are, the kind of thing you do as consistently as brushing your teeth. 
So slow and steady is the best kind of speed when it comes to body transformation.
</span><br>




<center  style="color:blue;font-size:30px">Get a detailed plan</center>

<span style="font-family:arial;font-size:15px">
It has to be as clear and as detailed as humanly possible. 
It'll be hard enough to stick to any kind of routine if you are not used to exercise and dietary restrictions,
 so you shouldn't make it harder by wondering every now and then what's next. 
 Ideally you want something that'll give you day-by-day instructions and if you don't have it ready,
 sit down and put your own schedule together. The more vague the instructions the more likely you are to stray and give up.
 Make it easy for yourself to continue on the program you chose or designed for yourself and you’ll have higher chances of showing up. 
</span> <br>




<center  style="color:blue;font-size:30px">Do it for 30 days</center>

<span style="font-family:arial;font-size:15px">
That’s about how long it takes to build a habit - roughly a month.
  And if you can stick to something for as long as that 
  the chances are you’ll get into a routine of making better choices naturally and without thinking about it later on. 
  Don’t think about it as something you have to do for four weeks and just take it one day at a time. 
It’ll help if you keep a log and cross days out on the calendar to keep yourself accountable.
</span><br>



<center  style="color:blue;font-size:30px">Get your family and friends on board</center>

<span style="font-family:arial;font-size:15px">
Working out together is the ideal case scenario and that's something that can be a huge help in staying committed to the program so check to see if someone else from your immediate circle would like to join you.
 Show them your plan and organise a schedule everyone involved is aware of.
 You can use a shared Google calendar to notify everyone in advance about the upcoming workout. 
 If your family isn't participating it's important that you let them know when and what you'll be doing anyway so they know that you won't be available at those times.
 When people in your life aren't supporting you it's very difficult to stay on track, they may even be trying to sabotage or bet against you finishing your program so it is vital that you explain to them why you are doing it and why you need them to be on your side.
 Once they know it is truly important to you, they will help.
</span><br>


<center  style="color:blue;font-size:30px">Get equipped</center>

<span style="font-family:arial;font-size:15px">
And this is not just clothes or fitness gear,
 in fact you can do with pretty basic stuff.
 At this point the less you spend the better. 
 We very often feel that we are achieving something by spending money when all we are achieving is emptying our bank accounts.
 You do need some equipment you can put together with things you already know, however. 
 It can be helpful to have some workout suitable music, comfortable footwear and handy things like a timer (you can get a free app) and a water bottle.
 Think it through, do a test workout to see what it is you might need before you start.
 You want to make the whole process as seamless as possible and automate it as much as you can.
 It's the small things that usually make you skip a workout and are used as an excuse.

</span>



<center  style="color:blue;font-size:30px">Start a log</center>

<span style="font-family:arial;font-size:15px">
It’s important that you write down everything you do and eat and make yourself accountable for every action or non-action during your fitness journey.
 Record absolutely everything including the small things like when you picked stairs over elevator or when you did extra squats during a TV commercial – these are the small victories that will eventually add up and it’s important that you remember them. They will help you stay strong and keep to your resolution when you’ll be tempted to give up or skip a day or two or a week. 
 Keep a log where you can see it at all times, set reminder and cross days off a calendar to reinforce your commitment.
 We very often hide our logs and then it becomes an “out of sight – out of mind” situation.

<Q style="color:green;"> What's the Difference Between <span style="color:red;" >Fruit</span> and  <span style="color:rgb(150,255, 45);" > Vegetables</span> ?</Q>
 <p id="answer" style="-webkit-transition: 0.25s ease-out ; color: #000"><i>
fruits and vegetables are classified from both a botanical and culinary standpoint. Botanically, fruits and vegetables are classified depending on which part of the plant they come from. A fruit develops from the flower of a plant, while the other parts of the plant are categorized as vegetables. Fruits contain seeds, while vegetables can consist of roots, stems and leaves. From a culinary perspective, fruits and vegetables are classified based on taste. Fruits generally have a sweet or tart flavor and can be used in desserts, snacks or juices. Vegetables have a more mild or savory taste and are usually eaten as part of a side dish or main course.

<Q style="color:green">Is <span style="color:red;" >Fruit</span> Safe for People With Diabetes?</Q>

<p id="answer" style="-webkit-transition: 0.25s ease-out ;color: #000">Most dietary recommendations for people with diabetes suggest eating plenty of fruits
and vegetables ,Current nutrition guidelines recommend that people with diabetes consume 2–4 servings
of fruit per day, which is the same as the general population ,Still, some people restrict the amount
they eat because they are worried about the sugar content,However, studies show that when sugar is
consumed in a whole fruit, it has very little effect on blood sugar levels,What's more, fruit is high
in fiber, which actually slows the digestion and absorption of sugar, improving overall blood sugar
control ,The fiber in fruit can also reduce insulin resistance and may help protect against type 2
diabetes,Fruits also contain polyphenols, which have been shown to improve blood sugar control
.Furthermore, eating more fruits and vegetables has been linked with lower levels of oxidative
stress and inflammation in people with diabetes .That being said, not all fruits are created equal.
Some of them raise blood sugar more than others, and diabetics are encouraged to monitor their blood
sugar levels after eating to figure out which foods they should limit
